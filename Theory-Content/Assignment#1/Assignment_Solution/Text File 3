There was once a poor servant-girl, who was industrious and cleanly,
and swept the house every day, and emptied her sweepings on the great heap in front of
the door. One morning when she was just going back to her work, she found a letter on
this heap, and as she could not read, she put her broom in the corner, and took the
letter to her master and mistress, and behold it was an invitation from the elves,
who asked the girl to hold a child for them at its christening. The girl did not know
what to do, but at length, after much persuasion, and as they told her that it was not
right to refuse an invitation of this kind, she consented.
